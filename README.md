An iOS application for storing items, and also sorting them into collections.

This is my final year project for university. It makes use of Realm as a database, and uses the ImagePicker framework for taking photos and including them in objects.

The idea behind the app is that people like to collect things, but regularly forget what they are. So whether it's a book collection, or group of items such as shoes, you can add different items, and also store them inside different collections.

I don't plan on releasing it to the public, because I think it will require a lot more work for it to be a viable product. However I will be opening it up on TestFlight for anyone that wants to test it. You can sign up by [entering your name and email on this form](https://chrishannah.typeform.com/to/MWC8Qg).
